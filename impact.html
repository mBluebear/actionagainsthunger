                    Action Against Hunger’s methods for identifying and rescuing populations afflicted with acute
                    malnutrition are internationally renowned, having pioneered revolutionary nutrition products and
                    field tested treatment protocols that have become industry standards.

                    From rural mountain villages to the confines of refugee camps to ethnically divided cities, Action
                    Against Hunger treats and prevents malnutrition in over 40 countries around the world. Our programs
                    are launched most often during times of crisis and focus on the most vulnerable, including young
                    children and women who are pregnant or nursing.

                    <h3>What We Do</h3>

                    <h4>Evaluate Nutritional Needs</h4>
                    To assess the root causes of a malnutrition outbreak, we collect baseline data on key nutritional
                    indicators like local capacities and resources, cultural practices, infrastructure, and geography.
                    These nutrition surveys are essential for mounting an effective, customized response.

                    <h4>Treat Acute Malnutrition</h4>
                    We treat cases of severe acute malnutrition with inpatient care (for those with medical
                    complications) and with community-based, outpatient programs. Without treatment severely
                    malnourished women and children would likely face imminent death.

                    <h4>Prevent Acute Malnutrition</h4>
                    Our prevention activities provide Ready-to-Use-Foods to patients discharged from therapeutic care,
                    children with moderate acute malnutrition, and children in communities faced with seasonal hunger.
                    Prevention can save millions of lives while long-term solutions are developed.

                    <h4>Build Local Capacity</h4>
                    We strengthen public health systems to combat malnutrition. We field teams that consist
                    overwhelmingly of local staff and integrate our programs into existing health structures. When
                    crises subside, we ensure local capacity is in place to support continued improvements in
                    communities’ nutritional health.
