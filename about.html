                    Nicolas Villeminot, Water, Sanitation & Hygiene Technical Advisor for Action Against Hunger, started working in 2005 in numerous countries and contexts across the ACF network. In Laos, Myanmar or Haiti, he worked as a Program Manager on post-crisis or long term projects, engaging his teams in natural resources management through the design and construction of water supply systems, wells, boreholes, sanitary infrastructures or toilets; while ensuring local participation and ownership through community-based management systems and public health and hygiene awareness.

                    As a Water, Sanitation and Hygiene coordinator, Nicolas was posted in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Cote d’Ivoire, where he defined the technical strategy according to evolving needs, oversaw the various projects across the country, and coordinated with national stakeholders to ensure the highest impact and best use of resources.

                    More recently, Nicolas was a WASH advisor in the ACF Paris headquarters for over 3 years, before transferring to New York. He provides technical guidance to the teams, ensures quality and coherence of the interventions, and provides trainings and capacity building to field practitioners or students.

                    Nicolas was engaged in major emergency responses at field level following the 2005 Pakistan earthquake, conflict in post-tsunami Sri Lanka, cyclone Nargis in Myanmar, and he supported the ACF responses in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake and during the major cholera outbreak. He also gained experience in longer term programming in both rural and urban areas of Cote d’Ivoire, Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Myanmar or Madagascar.

                    Native of France, Nicolas obtained a MSc in environmental engineering from Ecole des Mines de Douai before starting his international career in the USA, Denmark and Japan.
